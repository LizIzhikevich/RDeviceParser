# RDeviceParser
WORK IN PROGRESS: The purpose of this Rhetorical Device parser is to be able to identify popular rhetorical elements within given texts. Upon completion, it will be used to analyze literature studied throughout history and modern high schools and see if any quantifiable similarities exist between texts that are deemed "of literary merit."
